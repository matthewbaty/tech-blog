This application will allow the user to view blog posts made by all users of the site, but will not allow them to comment, post a blog, or update a blog post unless they are logged in. If the user doesn't have an account, they can make one by submitting a username, email, and password. Once they have an account they will be able to post blogs, update them, and comment on other blog posts submitted by other users of the site. This app is fully functional and is also optimized to be viewed on a mobile device.
